					<ul>
						<li>The real Chris Gardner, whose life the film is based on, actually scored an impressive 88% on his
							Dean Witter training exam, which is a formal, structured training program for account executives.
							Even though in reality, the program accepted most people who passed the test.

						</li>
						<li>Gardner invested his life savings in portable bone density scanners, which he struggled to sell
							throughout the film. These devices were only a slight improvement over standard X-rays and were

							the stockbroker world, despite not having a college education. He was top of his class in high
							school (even though his graduating class only had 12 students) and he waw also first in his Navy
							class of 20. <a href="https://www.funtrivia.com/en/Movies/Pursuit-of-Happyness-The-19853.html"
